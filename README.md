# CNNwasteClass

This project was performed as part of a bigger funded project in SASTRA University, a **smart waste management system**
The objective of this project was to not just build a CNN classifier, but use this as a platform to analyse the effectiveness of building CNN models from scratch rather than using transfer learning methods 
This particular project use InceptionV3 model and compares it with a manually written CNN architecture
